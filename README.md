Development of a service for the company "Silant"


The service stores the following data about Silant warehouse equipment:

     loader equipment;
     place of use;
     history of maintenance, breakdowns and repairs.

The service implements authorization, including various roles: guest, client, service organization and manager.
Each role has its own level of access to viewing and editing data.

The project API will be available to authorized users via the link - http://127.0.0.1:8000/api_silant/

The target audience of the service is everyone who is involved in working with forklifts.

Namely:

     equipment operators: those who buy equipment;
     service organizations: those who repair it;
     representatives of the equipment manufacturer: those who produce the equipment, that is, ChZSA themselves.
